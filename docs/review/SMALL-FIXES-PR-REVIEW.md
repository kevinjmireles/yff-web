## 🔍 Detailed Changes

### 1. `/api/test-auth` - Cookie Semantics Fix

**Problem:** 
- Only accepted `?token=`, not `?t=`
- Returned 401 when env unset (should be 200 no-op)
- Always `secure: true` (breaks localhost)
- No cache-control header
- Couldn't clear cookie properly

**Solution:**
- ✅ Accepts both `?token=` and `?t=` 
- ✅ Returns 200 with message when TEST_ACCESS_TOKEN unset
- ✅ Clears cookie when no param provided (with consistent attrs)
- ✅ Returns 403 on token mismatch
- ✅ Sets cookie to the token value itself (middleware alignment)
- ✅ `secure` only in production
- ✅ Added `Cache-Control: no-store`
- ✅ Cookie TTL: 1 day
- ✅ Consistent `NextResponse.json` usage
- ✅ Method guards for POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE

**Test Cases:**
```bash
# 1. No env var set -> 200 OK
GET /api/test-auth
# Expected: { ok: true, message: 'test access token not configured' }

# 2. Clear cookie -> 200 OK
GET /api/test-auth
# Expected: { ok: true, message: 'cookie cleared' }, cookie maxAge=0

# 3. Token match -> 200 OK
GET /api/test-auth?token=SECRET123
# Expected: { ok: true, message: 'cookie set' }, cookie set to SECRET123

# 4. Token match (short param) -> 200 OK
GET /api/test-auth?t=SECRET123
# Expected: { ok: true, message: 'cookie set' }, cookie set to SECRET123

# 5. Token mismatch -> 403
GET /api/test-auth?token=WRONG
# Expected: { ok: false, code: 'INVALID_TOKEN' }

# 6. Wrong method -> 405
POST /api/test-auth
# Expected: { ok: false, error: 'Use GET, not POST' }
```

### 2. `/api/health` - Cache-Control Header

**Problem:**
- Health check responses could be cached by browsers/proxies

**Solution:**
- ✅ Added `Cache-Control: no-store` header
- ✅ Preserved existing payload structure: `{ ok, service, timestamp }`

**Test Case:**
```bash
curl -I http://localhost:3000/api/health
# Expected: Cache-Control: no-store in headers
```

---

### 3. `/admin/campaigns` - Legacy Redirect

**Problem:**
- Old Make.com webhook form at /admin/campaigns is deprecated
- Users/docs may still reference old path

**Solution:**
- ✅ Simple server-side redirect to `/admin/send`
- ✅ Preserves admin auth requirement (middleware still applies)
- ✅ Clean, minimal implementation

**Test Case:**
```bash
# Visit /admin/campaigns -> redirects to /admin/send
```

---

### 4. `/api/admin/content/promote` - Admin Guard

**Problem:**
- TODO comment: "Add admin authentication check here"
- Route was unprotected despite middleware

**Solution:**
- ✅ Added `requireAdmin(request)` guard at top of handler
- ✅ Early return if unauthorized (401 JSON)
- ✅ Removed TODO comment

**Security Impact:**
- Route is now double-protected (middleware + route-level guard)
- Defense in depth pattern

**Test Case:**
```bash
# Without admin cookie -> 401
POST /api/admin/content/promote -d '{"dataset_id":"uuid"}'
# Expected: { ok: false, code: 'UNAUTHORIZED' }
```

---

### 5. `src/lib/flags.ts` - Compatibility Shim

**Purpose:**
- Allow legacy code to import from `@/lib/flags`
- Canonical import remains `@/lib/features`

**Implementation:**
```typescript
export * from './features'
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Zero runtime overhead
- ✅ Clean migration path
- ✅ Documented in architecture/auth-and-gate.md

---

### 6. Environment Documentation Updates

**Added to ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md:**
- ✅ `ADMIN_PASSWORD` - Admin login password
- ✅ `TEST_ACCESS_TOKEN` - Production test access token
- ✅ `TEST_ACCESS_ENFORCE_PROD_ONLY` - Gate enforcement scope
- ✅ `UNSUB_SECRET` - HMAC signing secret for unsubscribe links
- ✅ `SUPABASE_URL` - Server-side admin client requirement

**Added to docs/architecture/auth-and-gate.md:**
- ✅ Feature Flags section with all 7 flags documented
- ✅ Usage examples
- ✅ Configuration guidance
- ✅ Default behavior explanation

---
